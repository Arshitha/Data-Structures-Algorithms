**fourA**

The program goes through every character until the end of file. Each time 'U' is found, counter is set to 1 and buid[0] 
stores zero. It then checks for contiguous 8 digits if it exists, sums them up and if the sum is in the range [31,68]
then it increments the  idTotal variable. 

However, in my program, I wasn't able to take into the account one of the edge cases because of which the total number of
BU IDs found are 87822.

**fourC**

The program searches for the longest palindrome by first copying the entire text into a buffer and then checking for each
substring within the text file for palindrome. 

It consists of four user defined functions, which perform the function of copying the text file, copying the substring, 
checking for spaces and checking for the longest palindrome. 

Struct called pair is used to store the starting and the ending location of the substring being checked. 

The answer that was returned by the program was as follows:
207343189 207343200
" l v r v l "

Length of this palindrome is 11.
